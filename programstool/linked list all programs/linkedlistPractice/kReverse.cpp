Send Feedback
Implement kReverse( int k ) in a linked list i.e. you need to reverse first K elements then reverse next k elements and join the linked list and so on.
Indexing starts from 0. If less than k elements left in the last, you need to reverse them as well. If k is greater than length of LL, reverse the complete LL.
You don't need to print the elements, just return the head of updated LL.
Input format :

Line 1 : Linked list elements (separated by space and terminated by -1)

Line 2 : k

Sample Input 1 :
1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 -1
4
Sample Output 1 :
4 3 2 1 8 7 6 5 10 9
Sample Input 2 :
1 2 3 4 5 -1
2
Sample Output 2 :
2 1 4 3 5 
Sample Input 3 :
1 2 3 4 5 6 7 -1
3
Sample Output 3 :
3 2 1 6 5 4 7

//head is the head of the linked list, n is number of elements to be reversed
// Following is the node structure
/**************
class node{
public:
    int data;

    node(int data){

        this->next=NULL;
    }
};

node* kReverse(node*head,int n)
{
    //write your code here
   node* current = head;
   node* next = NULL;
   node* prev = NULL;
    int count = 0;   
    while (current != NULL && count < n)
    {
        next  = current->next;
        current->next = prev;
        prev = current;
        current = next;
        count++;
    }
    if (next !=  NULL)
       head->next = kReverse(next, n); 
    return prev;
