Ways To Make Coin Change
Send Feedback
You are given an infinite supply of coins of each of denominations D = {D0, D1, D2, D3, ...... Dn-1}. You need to figure out the total number of ways W, in which you can make change for Value V using coins of denominations D.
Note : Return 0, if change isn't possible.
Input Format
Line 1 : Integer n i.e. total number of denominations
Line 2 : N integers i.e. n denomination values
Line 3 : Value V
Output Format
Line 1 :  Number of ways i.e. W
Constraints :
1<=n<=10
1<=V<=1000
Sample Input 1 :
3
1 2 3
4
Sample Output
4
Sample Output Explanation :
Number of ways are - 4 total i.e. (1,1,1,1), (1,1, 2), (1, 3) and (2, 2).



int countWaysToMakeChange(int denominations[], int numDenominations, int value){

  /*  Don't write main().
   *  Don't read input, it is passed as function argument.
   *  Return output and don't print it.
   *  Taking input and printing output is handled automatically.
