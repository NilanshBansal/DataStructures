Given a NxM matrix containing Uppercase English Alphabets only. Your task is to tell if there is a path in the given matrix which makes the sentence “CODINGNINJA” .
There is a path from any cell to all its neighbouring cells. A neighbour may share an edge or a corner.
Input Format :
Line 1 : Two space separated integers N  and M, where N is number of rows and M is number of columns in the matrix.
Next N lines : N rows of the matrix. First line of these N line will contain 0th row of matrix, second line will contain 1st row and so on
Assume input to be 0-indexed based
Output Format :
Return 1 if there is a path which makes the sentence “CODINGNINJA” else return 0.
Constraints :
1 <= N <= 100
1 <= M <= 100
